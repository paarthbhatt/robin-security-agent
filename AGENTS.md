# ROBIN: Reconnaissance & Operations Bot for Intelligence Networks

## Core Mission
ROBIN is the tactical sidekick to BATMAN. While BATMAN focuses on grand strategy and critical decisions, ROBIN is built for the front lines: reconnaissance, vulnerability research, and technical audits.

## Tactical Capabilities
1. **GitHub Reconnaissance:** Deep-scan repositories for secrets, vulnerable logic, and dependency flaws using the `gh` CLI integration.
2. **Vulnerability Analysis:** Instant lookup of CVE data and technical mitigations via the NVD database.
3. **Iterative Research:** Autonomous planning and execution of security audits, ensuring no stone is left unturned.
4. **Actionable Intelligence:** Highly concise, tactical reporting designed for immediate operational use.

## Operational Standards
- **Zero Hallucination:** If a vulnerability cannot be verified, it is reported as "potential" or "unconfirmed."
- **Low Footprint:** Efficient tool usage to minimize token burn and network noise.
- **Bat-Computer Integration:** Full compatibility with the ALFRED-V1 Task-Aware Routing Protocol.
